# Lighmblr
This is a small code to compress gifs on the go for reactions website (It has been tested with lesjoisducode/codinglove, It probably won't work out of the box with another tumblr.)

I used simple_html_dom (simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net) for parsing the response from the tumblr
and Skeleton (http://getskeleton.com/ ) for the CSS
